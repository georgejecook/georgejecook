Hello! I'm [George Cook](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgejecook/). I love engineering high quality code. I take great pride in my craft, and produce highly extensible and maintainable applications. I'm extremely good at refactoring apps - I'll get into that below; but if you're a serious organization, and your code is getting stale, or hard to work with, then getting you back on track is one of my specialties, and I'd love to help you!

**I'm really enthusiastic about Roku development in general** : really - and I've got the goods to prove it :) ! Here's some of the things I've done/do:

 - Wrote a beautiful unit testing framework for brightscript developers, called [rooibos](https://github.com/georgejecook/rooibos) - it's based on Mocha, and it's awesome - I use it all the time to keep my productivity high and deliver quality code
 - Heavily contributed to the [Brightscript language vscode extension](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/), which is the number 1 ide extension for roku developers
 - Member of the [roku community](https://github.com/rokucommunity/) group of developers, who create open source tools for roku developer
 - Contributor to [brighterscript](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript) language
 - Created an MVVM framework [maestro](https://github.com/georgejecook/maestro/blob/master/docs/index.md), which includes the following features:
   - The first ever implementation of _brighterscript_, a _soon to be released language_, which is like typescript for brightscript
   - MVVM base clases
   - iOS style view classes and navigation
   - xml bindings
   - iOC implementation
   - a new, easier to use, more powerful, better performing list component (wip)
   - Which means I get to work 2-400% faster than other devs out there, and so do you, if you use it as well :)
 - Wrote a logging framework, tailored to brightscript and roku development, called [rLog](https://github.com/georgejecook/rLog)
 - Wrote a lightweight processor, a bit like awk, just for brightscript, named [burp](https://github.com/georgejecook/burp)
 - Started the popular, and awesome [Roku developer slack group](http://tiny.cc/nrdf0y)

# Refactoring failing code bases/getting software back on track

 I started coding when I was 6, 35 years ago. I'm as passionate now as I was then; but I've got a whole lot of acumen, and natural coding talent. That allows me to hold extremely large codebases in my head, even crazy-insane, poorly architected ones, and rewrite them over a few weeks. Over my career I built a solid name for being able to come into a project, understand the current code, identify the issues, and refactor the codebase, with low regression risk, while converting unmaintainable code bases to highly maintainable one's with solid patterns.

 I _love_ that kind of work as well - if you've got a project in dire straits, and don't want to lose a fortune; then take advantage of my experience, OCD and my wife's ability to let me disappear for a few 70 hour weeks: you will never regret it :D

# Let's talk!
 
 I probably sound arrogant; but I want you to know what a great benefit I will be to you and your project - I offer a lot more besides these tidbits here. Why not ping me on mail/roku slack group/linked in, and we can further chat. I _really_ like people _and_ computer software and I work on every project as if it were my own: as far as I'm concerned; your success is my success. So [get in touch!](mailto:george@tantawowa.com), and let's see what I can do to help.

# Why is your marketing page so ugly?

 I've not really looked for work for 15 or so years, getting a lot of repeat business and referrals. I prefer to do great work, with all my heart and soul, and use my time for open source projects instead of marketing. I do however, _really_ enjoy OTT and especially Roku work, so I'm making an effort to keep myself more in this space.
